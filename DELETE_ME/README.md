# Experiments

The experiments are run 30 times each. Each experiment's result is then saved in a list and the result is plotted using a python script.
The experiments format is the following:
- hypothesis: explains which parameters are changed and how.
Also, it explains what we think will happen by changing the input.

- Actual results: show what happens in reality and comment the results.

## Experiment 1

- Hypothesis: start with a low value of buyers (2) and sellers (1), then increment these values and keep the other fixed:
	* r = 5
	* sMax = 10
	* epsilon = 0.25
	* biddingFactorMax = 2
For a total of 30 iterations for both Pure and Leveled commitment.
